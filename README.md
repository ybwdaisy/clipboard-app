# Privacy Policy

Clipboard is a clipboard management tool designed for iOS and iPadOS.

This privacy policy applies to the main application itself and its extension.

## Read the clipboard

First, reading the clipboard on iOS requires the app to be active.

Second, if you are using iOS 14 or above, you will be prompted for every clipboard action.

We read the clipboard with your authorization.

## iCloud Sync

Clipboard implements iCloud syncing, which uses Apple's iCloud service. This service is fairly secure and trusted by users around the world.

## Data collected

The Clipboard application itself does not collect any of your data. All private information remains on your device forever and we have no control over it.

## Change of this privacy policy

We may update this privacy policy. Therefore, it is recommended that you check this page periodically to see what is updated.
